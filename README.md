Emails To A Young Programmer
============================

This is my humble attempt at distilling what little I know about my passion, which is programming.

I read, I type, I learn, I abstract, I design, I code. I enjoy.

Some excerpts from the ones we should truly learn from:

> Letter to a young programmer
> Dear (insert name here),

> I heard you enjoy a certain programming language named Python. Programming is a wonderful activity. I am a little jealous that you have access to computers at your age; when I grew up I didn't even know what a computer was! I was an electronics hobbyist though, and my big dream was to build my own electronic calculator from discrete components. I never did do that, but I did build several digital clocks, and it was amazing to build something that complex and see it work. I hope you dream big too -- programmers can make computers (and robots!) do amazing things, and this is a great time to become a programmer. Just imagine how much faster computers will be in five or ten years, and what you will be able to do with your skills then!
