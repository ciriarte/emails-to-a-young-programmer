Emails To A Young Programmer
============================

### Preface

This is my humble attempt at distilling what little I know about my passion, which is programming.

I read, I type, I learn, I abstract, I design, I code. I enjoy.

Some excerpts from the ones we should truly learn from:

> Letters to a young poet
> Dear Sir,

> ... You ask whether your verses are any good. You ask me. You have asked others before this. You send them to magazines. You compare them with other poems, and you are upset when certain editors reject your work. Now (since you have said you want my advice) I beg you to stop doing that sort of thing. You are looking outside, and that is what you should most avoid right now. No one can advise or help you - no one. There is only one thing you should do. Go into yourself. Find out the reason that commands you to write; see whether it has spread its roots into the very depths of your heart; confess to yourself whether you would have to die if you were forbidden to write.

This is how I feel whenever someone asks me to review their code. I could not write more sincere words about my thoughts regarding other's people work. But I am often touch by the struggle. Because I've been there as well, fighting against my own ignorance.

> Letter to a young programmer
> Dear (insert name here),

> I heard you enjoy a certain programming language named Python. Programming is a wonderful activity. I am a little jealous that you have access to computers at your age; when I grew up I didn't even know what a computer was! I was an electronics hobbyist though, and my big dream was to build my own electronic calculator from discrete components. I never did do that, but I did build several digital clocks, and it was amazing to build something that complex and see it work. I hope you dream big too -- programmers can make computers (and robots!) do amazing things, and this is a great time to become a programmer. Just imagine how much faster computers will be in five or ten years, and what you will be able to do with your skills then!
